INTRODUCTION                                                  *zettelkasten.nvim*
================================================================================

`zettelkasten.nvim` is a plugin to make it eaiser to use Zettelkasten note
taking system: https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/

It is meant to provide the following features in a way that is consistent with
Vim's own features:

1. Note ID competion 2. ID generation 3. Jumpting to references 4. Jumping to
tags 5. Listing tags

All relevant options are set automatocally if they have not been set before.
If they were set, these are the options that you can use to get the best
experience. These options may change, make sure the check the file type file: >

    setlocal tagfunc=v:lua.zettelkasten.tagfunc
    setlocal isfname+=-,:
    setlocal iskeyword+=:,-
    setlocal suffixesadd+=.md
    setlocal keywordprg=:ZkHover
    setlocal completefunc=v:lua.zettelkasten.completefunc

ZETTELKASTEN.NVIM 101                                     *zettelkasten.nvim-101*
================================================================================

The plugin does not introduce any new syntax for note taking. You can take
advantage of the markdown syntax with headers, tags, and links. You can refer
to a note by wrapping the note ID (i.e The file name.) with double angle
brackets.

>
    This note refers to [[2022-02-27-06-05-03]] which was created using
    :ZkNew.
    It can also refer to an [[existing_note]]. With this approach, you won't
    be able to use `:help CTRL-]` to jump to the file buy you can still use
    `:help gf`

`zettelkasten.nvim` also assumes a single folder where all the notes reside.
If you need to organize things you can use `#tags` to group them or create a
note that will be used as a reference for other notes.

PHILOSOPHY                                              *zettelkasten-philosophy*
================================================================================

`zettelkasten.nvim` embraces Vim by trying its hardest to not create new
commands or mappings. Everything this plugin provides should ideally be
useable with existing Vim options, mappings, and commands.

Where possible, Lua API should be exposed to others can extend this plugin's
functionality or create their own plugins on top of this one (e.g telescope
pickers.).

PREVIEWING NOTES                                     *zettelkasten-preview-notes*
================================================================================

To review a note, you can either use |K| mapping to execute |keywordprg| or
use any of the preview window tag mappings to open the note in a preview
window. Note that when the preview window commands are used (e.g |CTRL-W }|),
|preview-window| is used. If you want to customize the preview window, use
`preview_command` when setting up the plugin and rely on |K| command.

    include ~

    |include| commands can be used to see the references as well. You can use
    `[I` to display all the lines that contain the reference under the cursor.

MAPS                                                          *zettelkasten-maps*
================================================================================

Buffer Local ~

                                                                *zettelkasten-[I*
[I      Lists the notes that reference the note ID under the cursor. Available
        in markdown buffers and plugin specific buffers.


COMMANDS                                                  *zettelkasten-commands*
================================================================================

Global ~

ZkNew                                                                    *:ZkNew*

    Creates a new buffer with a markdown file type. If {notes_path} option was
    set with |zettelkasten-setup|, it'll change the working directory.


ZkHover {-preview} {-return-lines} {note_id}                           *:ZkHover*

    Implements |keywordprg|. This command is set to |keywordprg| option if
    |keywordprg| is not already set.

    If `-preview` is passed to the command, a preview window will be used to
    show the note contents.

    If `-return-lines` can only be used when `-preview` is used. When this
    argument is passed, this command will return the note content in a list
    instead of using `preview_command`.

    Example: >
        setlocal keywordprg=:ZkHover\ -preview
        setlocal keywordprg=:ZkHover\ -preview\ -return-lines

ZkBrowse                                                              *:ZkBrowse*

    Just a command that runs `edit zk://browser`.
    In this buffer, you can use the same short cuts that you use to navigate
    and open notes as in the markdown files.

LUA                                                            *zettelkasten-lua*

        {opts} (optional, table)
            - {notes_path} (optional, string): Defaults to an empty string. If

              directory. If this is not set. you need to make sure that your
              working directory is your notes directory. Otherwise some
              features may not work.
            - {preview_command} (optional, string): The command to use to
              preview a note. This will be used with |:ZkHover -preview|
              command. The command must take one string argument as the name
              of the note file. This can be used to configure
              zettelkasten.nvim so the hover previews are (for example) shown
              in a hover window.
            - {browseformat} (optional, string): Used to format each line when
              browsing the notes. Here's the supported values:
